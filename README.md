# TUTOR HUB PROJECT 

This is the client application for the TutorsHub project.

The client side of the TutorsHub application provides a user interface for students and tutors to interact. The app allows users to view profiles, schedule sessions, and manage their accounts. The client communicates with the back-end services through API calls to display relevant data for the user.

For more information on the back-end services, refer to the main project repository
